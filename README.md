# Ancient Gaming Test

This project is developed as result of the Game Developer (Technical Test) for Ancient Gaming studio by Jesús Pérez de Miguel.

The project has been developed with:
* Pixi.js 8.4.1 
* Typescript 5.6.2
* Webpack 5.95.0

In order to focus on the tasks functionality the environment tech stack has been kept simple and there is only "development" mode.

## Feedback

Some comments on the challenges I have encountered throughout the development of the tasks.

### Task 1
* The main challenge has been the proper handling of the order of the cards to avoid overlapping issues, especially if the animation interval is less than the required 1 second. It should be going well for now.
* Another difficulty is the proper arrangement of the elements and the repositioning and resizing of the container in response to a screen change. I would like to have more time to establish a correct hierarchy of layers and a well-defined layout.

### Task 2
* I probably didn't fully understand the task. It seems a bit trivial, so I'm probably missing something. My apologies if that's the case. However, I didn't encounter any problems with this task.

### Task 3
* I was unable to get the Pixi-Particle library up and running in Pixi v8.4.1. And I'm not 100% satisfied with the possibilities of particle effects. So I decided to create my own homemade particle emitter.
Just like I did many times for complex effects, like nice coin fountains where you need to "feel" gravity.
Anyway, with the time I decided to invest in the task, this is the result, I hope you find it attractive.

### Last Thoughts
I hope you can forget the bugs and problems you will probably find. I suffer a bit leaving something not rolling as it should do, but unfortunatelly the time is out.
However, I had a lot of fun working on these tasks, thank you very much for that.
